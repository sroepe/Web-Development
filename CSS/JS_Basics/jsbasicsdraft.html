                <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a Web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programatic control over them.                        
                </p>

                        <a href>Variable Declaration</a>
                        <p>JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span id="emphasis">var x;</span>
                        </p>    
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href>Variable Assignment</a>
                        <p>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span id="emphasis">var x=10;></span>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href>Data Types</a>
                        <p>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span id="emphasis">true</span> or <span id="emphasis">false;</span> null - <span id="emphasis">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span id="emphasis">42</span> or <span id="emphasis">3.14159;</span> String - <span id="emphasis">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span id="emphasis">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span id="emphasis">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href>Conditionals</a>
                        <p>When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span id="emphasis">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span id="emphasis">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span id="emphasis">else</span> we execute this block of code;
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href>Loops</a>
                        <p>There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action a number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href>Function</a>
                        <p>Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example, imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started first we screw the legs to table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
                        </p>
